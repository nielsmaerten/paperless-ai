# Paperless-AI

An automated document analyzer for Paperless-ngx using OpenAI API, Ollama and all OpenAI API compatible Services to automatically analyze and tag your documents. \
It features: Automode, Manual Mode, Ollama and OpenAI, a Chat function to query your documents with AI, a modern and intuitive Webinterface. \
\
**Following Services and OpenAI API compatible services have been successfully tested:**

- Ollama
- OpenAI
- DeepSeek.ai
- OpenRouter.ai
- Perplexity.ai
- Together.ai
- VLLM
- LiteLLM
- Fastchat
- Gemini (Google)
- ... and there are possibly many more

> 🚀 **New Feature Announcement**  
> **Paperless-AI now includes a powerful, integrated RAG-powered Chat interface!**  
> Introducing a whole new way to interact with your Paperless-NGX archive: instead of browsing, filtering, or guessing which tags to search for — just ask.  
> Thanks to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), you can now search semantically across the full content of your documents and get human-like answers instantly.

> 🔍 **No more guessing. Just ask.**  
> Want to know _“When did I receive my electricity contract?”_, _“How much did I pay for the last car repair?”_ or _“Which documents mention my health insurance?”_ — Paperless-AI will find it for you, even if you don’t remember the exact title, sender, or date.

> 💡 **What does RAG bring to Paperless-NGX?**
>
> - True full-text understanding of your documents
> - Context-aware responses — beyond keyword search
> - Useful when dealing with large or chaotic document archives
> - Saves time, avoids frustration, and unlocks insights you may have forgotten you had stored
> - Blazingly fast answers backed by your own trusted data

> ⚠️ **Important Note**: If you're installing Paperless-AI for the **first time**, please **restart the container after completing the setup routine** (where you enter your API keys and preferences). This ensures that all services initialize correctly and your RAG index is built properly.  
> ➕ This step is **not required when updating** an existing installation.
